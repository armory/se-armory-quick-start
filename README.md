# se-armory-quick-start

## This is a wip to streamline the armory spinnaker quick start process. Goals of this work are:
* Minimize amount of steps required to bootstrap a minimum spinnaker service that can deploy a manifest to spinnaker cluster namespace (Ideally, fewer than 5 commands)
* Provide a quick start for those that have a k8s cluster that meetss pre-reqs and those that have no cluster
* Provide description of kustomize repo and purpose
* Provide description of minnaker and purpose
